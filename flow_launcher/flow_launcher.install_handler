#    This script attempts to register the Flow Launcher as the protocol handler for
#    links that look like flow-launcher://blah.
#
#    It should be sufficient for gnome apps like pidgin and kde apps
#    like konqueror. Firefox seems to pay attention to the gnome
#    settings at least to the degree that it recognizes links of the
#    form flow-launcher://blah as hot-links, but it may still ask you to
#    select the application the first time you click on one.
